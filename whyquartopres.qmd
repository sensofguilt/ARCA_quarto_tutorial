# Y use Quarto presentation

## Advantages

* It's cool
* It's interactive
* Everyone is going to be astonished

## Disadvantages

* HTML presentation are not stable
* You will not be invited at conferences

## FIRST THINGS FIRST

* GET YOUR YAML RIGHT
* set your revealjs with self-contained: true
* if you want to have incremental content, go for incremental: true, you can adjust non incremental stuff later.
* otherwise you can specify incremental: false and you can force increments later using . . .  (3 columns)
*then you may setup email, footer, logo, show-slide-number
